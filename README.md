# Flauxy Client
### All in one client

It is important to note that this project is not supposed to be the most polished and clean code ever, some things were indeed skidded from random/old sources that I honestly wouldn't remember where I got from (for instance the ESP/W2S logic)

## Why all in one?
Flauxy was originally a hacked client that saw its first buildable version in early 2022, it was shortly after abandoned by all developers (me included)
I decided to revive the client in 2024 as a "Falsing Client", since it's the only one of its kind, it's also technically the best :) 

## What is a falsing client?
Wh- Why! Don't you want to bypass anticheats usually?
####
Well yes, but no. My friends (who are much more knowledgeable about minecraft than I am) and I like falsing anticheats, but some things required tick perfect accuracy, or just automation to not be tiring, hence why this client was created. It aims to make minecraft's most obscure mechanics more easily usable
### What features does the client have ?
For blatant cheating it does not have many things you could find useful, but for falsing it has a few interesting modules we can go over
#### - Fast Math Hack
This module changes optifine's 1.8.8 sin table optimization with the one they use in the 1.8.9 L5 version of their mod. This optimization has a major flaw that allows you to simply break things through blocks if you are looking at the right angle
#### - Zoom
Customizable zoom, useful to false aim checks
#### - Consume Desync
Desyncs the item you are consuming, falses noslow checks
