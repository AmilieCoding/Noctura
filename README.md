# Flauxy
### An open source 1.8.8 minecraft hacked client
Originally made with three other developers (Auxy and t9a) the client was abandonned by everyone. I decided to make the source public as I'm the only active dev on the client.
The code was mainly written in early 2022, some things were indeed skidded; I do not care.

# AS THE CLIENT IS OLD, COOKIE ALTS ARE NOT SUPPORTED, if you want to add them feel free to do so

#### No you cannot sell a fork of this client
I think it goes without saying that if you want to fork this client you cannot sell it
## Goals of this client:
I never intended to sell any client whether it was skidded or not, I simply don't think anyone should be paying for mediocre clients, unfortunately it seems to be the norm to now buy shit clients (Myau, raven, dog)

#### Bypasses :
Flauxy does not bypass many anticheats as of now, but it used to aim at being the best Redesky client as well as a decent Funcraft client, development stopped as my motivation went down when both servers closed as well as my life got in the way. You may find some old Redesky bypasses in this client
